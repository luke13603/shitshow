    <h4>Season</h4>
    <p>Each FTC game season is classified into a season with each season's game being different than the previous year. Each season
      your team has a couple of months to build a robot (within compliance of the FTC rule book, updated every year) to complete certain tasks 
      during a tournament match. By completing certain tasks presented during a match, you will earn more points during a match (explained later).
      By earning points and wining a tournament match, you can advance your rank amongst 30-40 other teams at that tournament. Although, of course 
      it isn't all about the matches as judge presentations also play a huge factor in your final rank amongst the other teams. Judge presentations 
      are when you have to present your robot to the judges as well as anything else you did during the season to help you win certain awards. An
      example would be the stratasys award being the award given too the team who used the most 3D printed parts on their robot. In addition to 
      presenting a robot, you also have to present a engineering notebook that contains all the things that you did throughout the year. Ours includes
      daily entrys into the notebook, CAD models, our programs, etc.
